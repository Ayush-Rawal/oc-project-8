# Performance Audit

Performance Audit of our website and comparison with the competitor website([](todolistme.net)). For the purpose of this audit the website has been hosted at https://gallant-kilby-6d478e.netlify.app/

## Methodology
The audit is done using the chrome developer tools and Google's light house. From the developer tools, we primarily use the network tab, the performance tab and the code coverage. Lighthouse is a tool by google that measures key metrics like First Contentful Paint, Time to Interactive, and more, to give a score out of 100 and recommendations for improving performance.
